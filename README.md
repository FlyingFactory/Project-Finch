# Project-Finch

Notes:
- The .gitignore is the standard Unity one. Do not meddle unless you know what you're doing.
- Every "New Text Document" is a placeholder to make sure git detects the folder structure. You can remove it when there are actual things in the folder.
- The Unity project is under Source folder. The others are used for sharing other stuff using git.
- Scripts you write go under a folder with your name on it.
- To avoid merge conflicts, you can edit "your" scripts at any time, but you must ask for permission to edit others. Then, notify when you are done.
- Similarly for scene files, always ask before editing any scene files that don't have your name. You can make a copy of a scene in file explorer in the meantime and copy objects back when you get the permission.
- When asked for editing permissions, push ASAP and give the go ahead.
- Try to respect folder structure.
